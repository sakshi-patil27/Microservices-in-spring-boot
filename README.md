# Microservices-in-spring-boot with Security

This repository contains a set of microservices developed using Spring Boot, with integrated security features to ensure robust user authentication and authorization. The project demonstrates how to build scalable applications with secure communication between services.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Modular design with multiple independent services.
  - Each service handles a specific business capability.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**
  - Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
  - Role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.

- **Service Communication**
  - Uses RESTful APIs for communication between services.
  - Integrated service discovery (if applicable) to manage service instances.

- **Centralized Configuration**
  - Configuration management using Spring Cloud Config (if applicable) for consistent settings across services.

- **API Gateway**
  - Optional API Gateway implementation for routing requests and enforcing security policies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the microservices project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment with the required dependencies (Spring Boot, Spring Security, etc.).
3. Run each microservice independently.
4. Optionally, run the API Gateway if implemented.
5. Use tools like Postman to test the APIs and authentication features.

## Testing

- Each microservice is equipped with unit and integration tests to verify functionality and security features.
- Use JUnit and Mockito for testing the services.
